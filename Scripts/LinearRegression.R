# script to run linear regression, plotting coefficients and other analysis
# Export any plots you want to include in your final report as an image (to the images directory)
# Export your model object to an RDS file so you can load this file in your final report 
# Use the tidy, augment, or glance functions from the broom package to reference the modelâ€™s statistical findings
# Add a line in the Usage section on how to use this script
"
This script run linear regression, and any subsequent explorations and analyses using the cleaned data.
